# BookifyMobile

This project is the mobile client for the Bookify application.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will first need to set up the backend service.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Download the Backend Release:**
    Download the latest backend release from the following URL:
    [https://github.com/bozmund/Bookify/releases/tag/Release](https://github.com/bozmund/Bookify/releases/tag/Release)

2.  **Extract the Zip File:**
    Extract the contents of the downloaded `Release.zip` file to a directory of your choice. This will create a folder (e.g., `Bookify-Release`).

3.  **Run the Backend:**
    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate into the extracted folder (e.g., `cd Bookify-Release`), and then run the following command:
    ```bash
    dotnet ./WebApi.dll
    ```
    This will start the backend web API, which the mobile application will connect to.

### Mobile App Setup

(Further instructions for the mobile app setup would go here, such as opening in Android Studio, syncing Gradle, and running on an emulator or device.)
